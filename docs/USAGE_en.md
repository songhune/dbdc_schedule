# How to use (guest/admin)

- Choose mode from sidebar: `Guide` → `Guest` → `Admin` when needed.
- Participant password is only for loading/updating your own responses.
- Poll password protects admin actions (delete/finalize). Guests do **not** need it to vote.

## Guest mode
- Pick a poll; enter poll password if the host told you to.
- Enter name + participant password, click available slots, then save.
- Simple view (default) hides timeline/filters; uncheck to see them.

## Admin mode
- Log in with the admin password.
- Create poll: set date range/time window/slot length; click generated slots to include/exclude. Optional poll password for protecting delete/finalize.
- Edit poll: load selected poll → adjust → create (overwrite).
- Delete: type poll ID (and poll password if set) to confirm deletion.
- Finalize: review votes, pick a slot to finalize. An email draft appears.
